2. [Dawn.com](http://www.dawn.com) is one of Pakistan's leading daily English newspaper. They have an archive of over 60 news articles per day going back to 2010. I   [mined](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14Frh3Yq33bXFHG0fRT8xx05hRckbzwrA?usp=sharing)
 all the articles, as well as the different articles they linked to.


3. The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset used to introduce data science. I used it to [teach](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1grXmv8FX9u2acqSb_3YcjpRT1x63RMsB?usp=sharing) the data science lifescycle by training a deep learning model in the hopes that others would enjoy it as much as I did.




You can find some samples from other projects I have worked on in the adriatic1517 repository above.
