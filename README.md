## Hi, I am Emad.

Recently I have been working as a Software Engineer on blockchain technologies at [Fin3](https://www.fin3.tech). Here are some of my projects from my time at UC Berkeley:


1. [Dawn.com](http://www.dawn.com) is one of Pakistan's leading daily English newspaper. They have an archive of over 60 news articles per day going back to 2010. I   [mined](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14Frh3Yq33bXFHG0fRT8xx05hRckbzwrA?usp=sharing)
 all the articles, as well as the different articles they linked to.
2. PISA is the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment. PISA measures 15-year-oldsâ€™ ability to use their reading, mathematics and science knowledge and skills to meet real-life challenges. I [downloaded](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HM6oFJGMCbxvTB4XR3pnzTSWp1bvxTjJ?usp=sharing) all of the data for the 2018 survey and [cleaned](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nlmt00FGexRnwYCqXEHAcfSxCgQgR1we?usp=sharing) it.

3. [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. I wrote a [tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1da-TjrSTBaKOVZlbjhNSRg6Bx_HUU0kf?usp=sharing) on the first 5 questions to motivate high schoolers to take up coding back home in Pakistan.


4. The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset used to introduce data science. I used it to [teach](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1grXmv8FX9u2acqSb_3YcjpRT1x63RMsB?usp=sharing) the data science lifescycle by training a deep learning model in the hopes that others would enjoy it as much as I did.


5. [Zameen.com](https://www.zameen.com) is "the first and largest property portal in Pakistan and is among the top five property portals in the world." I used data about Islamabad, Pakistan to train a neural network to predict housing prices in there.
6. I created the most advanced [dictionary](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~emadsiddiq/run.fcgi/pashto/) available for my mother tongue Pashto. 
7. I used Sentiment Analysis to gather all [good news](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~emadsiddiq/run.fcgi/goodnews/) on one page at the beginning of the pandemic (no longer up to date). 


You can find some samples from other projects I have worked on in the adriatic1517 repository above.
